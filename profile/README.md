## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


### Welcome Letter to Students

Dear Students,

Welcome to Spring 2025! I am excited to teach and provide insights to my experience. However, I want to be upfront and honest with each of you. I want you to know that one of my main goals in teaching this class is to prepare you for industry and what is to come. 
In addition to passing this course for your major, one of the things I felt that lacked in academia is a connection to industry. Therefore, I encourage everyone to ask questions and I will be happy to explain my experience, what I think you should do to get a headstart, and how to use 
your knowledge in this course to your advantage.

I do not want any of you to fall behind so I beg of you to reach out with enough time. If you are affected by unforeseen circumstances and would like a 1-on-1 meeting, send an email! Do not hesitate to reach out as that might be your own downfall.

### Useful Resources

Please check the `Resources` tab of class's website. There will be a list of UCF resources and Industry resources.

### Fun Facts

My son's name is Benji. He is a border Collie that turns 5 this year. You will see him in lectures quite frequently so if you do not want to attend lecture because it's boring, attend it for him at least.
